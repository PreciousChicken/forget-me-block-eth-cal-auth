# forget-me-block-eth-cal-auth

Research Project hosting a RFC 5545 (iCalendar) compliant calendar on the Ethereum blockchain, for more details see the accompanying introduction at [Forget-me-block: Ethereum calendar](https://www.preciouschicken.com/blog/posts/forget-me-block-eth-cal/).

This proof of concept was built primarily using React (web front-end) and Truffle (Ethereum back-end).  A [live instance](https://forget-me-block-eth-cal-auth.preciouschicken.com/) on the Ropsten network is available for demonstration, assuming one has an Ethereum enabled browser (e.g. metamask).

Features an implementation of the [access restriction](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/access_restriction.html) solidity pattern.
